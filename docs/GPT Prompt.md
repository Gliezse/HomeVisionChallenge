I'll send you a code challenge premise, i want you to help me decide on technologies, libraries, approaches and everything necessary to generate a document to feed to Cursor plan agent, in conjunction of the premise itself. The technology should include: React, Typescript, Tailwind, Axios, TanStack React Query. Components should be componetisized and reusable, such as: tables, buttons. Use a modern font, chose one. Make the styling towards modern, clean style. On the infinite scroll logic, add 3 retries, then a button to manually retry at the bottom of the table.
The response from the api looks like this, make sure to include it in the document to back up the premise:

{
  "houses": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "address": "4 Pumpkin Hill Street Antioch, TN 37013",
      "homeowner": "Nicole Bone",
      "price": 105124,
      "photoURL": "https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/big-custom-made-luxury-house-260nw-374099713.jpg"
    }
  ]
}

And the premise is the next:

# Assignment

HomeVision Frontend Challenge

This is a take home interview for HomeVision that focuses primarily on writing clean code that accomplishes a very practical task. The challenge is to build a simple web app that displays an infinite scrolling of house data. We'd prefer if you used React (or a React-based framework like Next.js) but feel free to use any library for the UI components.
**Note**: this is a **flaky API**! That means that it will likely fail with a non-200 response code. Your code **must** handle these errors correctly so that all photos are displayed without issues.

API Endpoint
You can request the data using the following endpoint:
`https://staging.homevision.co/api_project/houses`

This route by itself will respond with a default list of houses (or a server error!). You can use the following URL parameters:

- page: the page number you want to retrieve (default is 1).

- per_page: the number of houses per page (default is 10).

## Requirements

- Use React and TypeScript

- Design and implement a system to display the results of the API calls to a user

- Include instructions on how to run the project

## Bonus Points

- Add some additional features that require more complex interactions

- Show off your understanding of what is required to build and run a production application — through comments and/or implementation of those requirements
